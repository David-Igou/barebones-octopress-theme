Barebones Octopress Theme

This is a WIP and is literally the product of me throwing together some basic themes, and then morphing it into something similar to my old plain html website. I am still adjusting this and there are still obvious issues and artifacts floating around, some of this code is probably never called, etc.

I know absolutely nothing about web design and just want a short, clean path to blog about my projects ;)

Code was pulled from several themes in: https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes
